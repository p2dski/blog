      "If you've ever played guitar, then you know the G string has a tendency to go out of tune much quicker than the rest of the strings. So I asked myself if the G string was the string I played most. It definately had the be the E string, right? Or perhaps the A string. But I figured the G string isn't played nearly as often. So I decided to figure out what the most played guitar string was. There is an easy way to do this. Just count the number of tabs on each string. The problem is tabs are presented kind of weird. \n",

      "We have to be clever knowing telling the program which string is which and when a new note is actually a new note. So, we're going to write a function called Count_Tabs that counts the number of notes on each string using guitar tabs. First, find the tabs you want to use. Copy them into a file, name the file, and save the file. To be safe, delete lines like '1st guitar solo' because they could screw up our parsing. Also, if it has 'e, B, G, D, A, E' before each line, delete those too or modify the code to account for those. I'll use Red Hot Chili Pepper's Snow in this example. You can view the file [here](https://raw.github.com/p2dski/blog/master/RHCP-Snow.txt).\n",
